Use It On A Virtual Machine Buddy. Be Careful With It, It Can F**K Your System.
It Can Do Many Things Like:

Anti-Debugging:

The script checks for the presence of common debugging tools (e.g., OllyDbg, IDA Pro, WinDbg, x64dbg) and exits if any are found. This is likely to prevent reverse engineering or analysis of the script.

File Overwriting:

The overwrite_file function overwrites a file with random data, making it unrecoverable.

File and Folder Deletion:

The delete_files_and_folders function recursively deletes files and folders in a specified directory (in this case, the root of the C: drive). It also overwrites files with random data before deletion.

System File Corruption:

The corrupt_system_files function targets critical Windows system files (e.g., ntoskrnl.exe, winload.exe, and the SYSTEM registry hive) and overwrites them with random data. This can render the operating system unbootable.

Persistence:

The add_to_startup function adds the script to the Windows startup registry, ensuring it runs every time the system boots.

Privilege Escalation:

The run_as_admin function attempts to run the script with administrator privileges, which is necessary to perform destructive actions on system files.
